Description: This document describes the process required to generate an XML file for VisMAN using MuJava to perform the mutation and JUnit for testing.

1) Use MuJava to generate a set of mutants for the program.
2) Copy and paste the results from MuJava into a directory with the following internal structure:
	Testing Directory
	|
	---mutants
	|	|
	|	--- [contents of mujava results folder]
	|	
	---original
	|	|
	|	--- [contents of mujava src folder]
	|
	---testing_location
	|	|
	|	--- junit-4.10.jar
	|	|
	|	--- TestResultsSingle.class
	|	|
	|	--- TestResultsSingle.java
	|	|
	|	--- {JUnitTests}.class
	|	
	---PackagedTestHarness.sh
	|
	---XMLGenerator.sh
3) Run $PackagedTestHarness.sh <name of file to begin compilation process> <name of test file>
4) Run $XMLGenerator.sh <location of test harness results file> <location of original directory> <location of JUnit source file> <location of mutant directory>
5)
